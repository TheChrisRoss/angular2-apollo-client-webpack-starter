# angular2-apollo-client-webpack-starter

A graphql ready starter kit for [Angular2](https://angular.io/) using [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client) and Webpack. This starter kit is built to seamlessly 
integrate with the [scaphold.io](https://scaphold.io)'s powerful GraphQL-as-a-Service platform.

Out of the box, the application handles authentication and exhibits pagination using GraphQL connections. The
template also comes packed with a few other goodies.

## Quick start

- Go to [scaphold.io](https://scaphold.io) and create an account.
- Create an application and get your GraphQL API's url from the dropdown in the nav bar.
- Setup this starter kit

```bash
# clone our repo
$ git clone https://github.com/scaphold-io/angular2-apollo-client-webpack-starter.git my-app

# update /my-app/src/config.ts with your scaphold api url
$ cd my-app
$ vi src/config.ts

# install the dependencies with npm
$ npm install

# start the server
$ npm start
```

Your application is now hooked up to a production GraphQL API and is ready for you
to build an awesome app.

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to start using your API.

## What's included?

* Apollo Client - A powerful, easy to use GraphQL client.
* Webpack - A popular, well designed module bundler for JavaScript projects.
* ES6, and ES7 support with babel.
* Source maps for debugging.
* Development server with live reload via webpack-dev-server.
* Production builds with cache busting.
* Unit testing via karma and jasmine.
* Integration testing via protractor.
* Code coverage when tests are run.

## Installing

* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`
* We tested this template with Node (`v4.x`+) and NPM (`3.x`+) but others will most likely work as well

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

## Developing

### Building

* single run: `npm run build`
* build files and watch for changes: `npm run watch`

### Generating Documentation

* `npm run docs`
* This uses [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.io/) and understand JavaDoc style tags 

## Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode: `npm run test-watch`

#### 2. Integration Tests

* single run: `npm e2e`
* live mode: `npm e2e-live`
